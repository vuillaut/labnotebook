Solved the problem doing:

Open the config in Docker desktop.

- Add `debug: false` in Docker Engine config

- Turn off `Use gRPC FUSE` for file sharing

- Turn off `Send usage statistics`


Note: from ~July 2023, docker desktop on mac osx has an experimental feature _Resource Saver mode: when this is set, Docker will use minimal CPU and memory when idle_
To enable: Settings / Features in development / Access experimental features
