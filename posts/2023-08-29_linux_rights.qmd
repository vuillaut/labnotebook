# problem

In `workdir`, a directory I created

I want to:

- specific user named `user1` to be able to create dirs and write his own files in /workdir/
- I keep writing and reading rights in `/workdir/` and all future subdirs and files
- user1 is not able to modify my files and dirs in `/workdir/`

I can't create a new group or deal with groups


# how to solve

Add `umask 002` in my `.bashrc`



```
cd /workdir
setfacl -d -m u:your_username:rwx .

setfacl -m u:user1:rwx .
setfacl -d -m u:user1:rwx .

chmod +t .
```
